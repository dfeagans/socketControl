socketControl
=============

Beginning with the socket.io example in [Node.js Succintly by Agus Kurniawan](https://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/nodejs), this is an experiment into controlling hardware and reporting physical sensors from a website. End goal would be a mobile-formatted website that allowed viewing a physical system's status and controlling its state.

## Current Plan ##

+ [ ] Set-up basic socket.io connection between a client and server.
+ [ ] Connect to a computer in situ using a local Node program that communicates to the serveer, and thus the client.
+ [ ] Connect directly to the computer's USB/serial port to expose the website to the physical system.
+ [ ] Display sensor data from the microcontroller and allow control from the website.
+ [ ] Make the system work with an XBEE wireless-USB radio.
+ [ ] Make things look good... maybe.
